namespace Util::Async {

/// Allows the creation and mapping of shared memory regions.
/// Such regions are created by one process and can be mapped into the address space of other processes.
/// Any changes to the memory region are visible to all processes that have mapped the region.
///
/// Typically, one process creates a new shared memory regions and then calls `publish()`
/// to make it available to other processes. After that, the created region is visible in the file system
/// under `/process/<pid>/shared/<name>`, where `<pid>` is the process id and `<name>` must be a unique identifier
/// given in the constructor of this class.
/// Other processes can then open the file and issue a `controlFile()` request with `Request::MAP`
/// to map the region into their address space. This is simplified by creating a `SharedMemory` object
/// with the constructor that takes a `Process` object and a name. Calling `map()` on that object
/// will open the file and issue the request.
///
/// ## Example (publisher process):
/// ```c++
/// // Create a new shared memory region named "myregion" with a size of 1 page (4096 bytes).
/// const auto sharedMemory = Util::Async::SharedMemory("myregion", 1);
///
/// // Copy a string into the shared memory region.
/// const auto address = sharedMemory.getAddress();
/// address.copyString("Hello, Shared Memory!");
///
/// // Publish the region to make it available to other processes.
/// if (!sharedMemory.publish()) {
///     Util::System::out << "Failed to publish shared memory region!"
///         << Util::Io::PrintStream::endl << Util::Io::PrintStream::flush;
///     return;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Example (mapping process):
/// ```c++
/// // The PID of the publisher process must be known.
/// // It can, for example, be communicated via pipes.
/// // This example assumes that the PID is 42.
/// const auto id = 42;
///
/// const auto sharedMemory = Util::Async::SharedMemory(id, "myregion", 1);
/// if (!sharedMemory.map()) {
///     Util::System::out << "Failed to map shared memory region!"
///         << Util::Io::PrintStream::endl << Util::Io::PrintStream::flush;
///     return;
/// }
///
/// const auto address = sharedMemory.getAddress();
/// const auto message = static_cast<const char*>(address.getAsPointer());
/// Util::System::out << "Message from shared memory: " << message
///     << Util::Io::PrintStream::endl << Util::Io::PrintStream::flush; // Should print "Hello, Shared Memory!"
/// ```

/// Represents a route in the IPv4 routing table.
/// A route defines how packets should be forwarded to reach a specific destination.
/// It is made up of the following components:
///  - A source address, which is the IP address of the interface that is sending the packet.
///  - A target address, which is the destination subnet for the packet.
///  - An optional next hop address, which is the IP address of the next router to forward the packet to.
///    In this case, the packet cannot be sent directly to the target address, but rather needs to be sent to another
///    host that will forward it to the target address.
///  - A device identifier, which is the identifier of the network interface that should be used to send the packet.
///
///  For example, a route could look like this:
///  `10.0.2.0/24 device eth0 source 10.0.2.15`
///  This means that packets with a destination address in the subnet `10.0.2.0/24` should be sent
///  via the network interface `eth0` which has the source IP address `10.0.2.15`.
///
///  Another example could be:
///  `default via 10.0.2.2 device eth0 source 10.0.2.15`
///  This is a default route, which means that packets that do not match any other route should take this route.
///  In this case, packets will be sent to the next hop address `10.0.2.2` regardless of their destination address.
///  This is a typical setup for a gateway that forwards packets to the internet.
///  Again, the packets will be sent via the network interface `eth0` with the source IP address `10.0.2.15`.

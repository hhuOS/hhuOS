///
/// const auto length = byteArrayStream.getLength(); // length is 7
/// auto position = byteArrayStream.getPosition(); // position is 0
/// auto remaining = byteArrayStream.getRemaining(); // remaining is 7
///
/// const auto a = static_cast<char>(byteArrayStream.read()); // read 'a'
/// const auto b = static_cast<char>(byteArrayStream.read()); // read 'b'
/// const auto c = static_cast<char>(byteArrayStream.read()); // read 'c'
/// position = byteArrayStream.getPosition(); // position is 3
/// remaining = byteArrayStream.getRemaining(); // remaining is 4
///
/// char defg[4];
/// byteArrayStream.read(reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(defg), 0, 4); // read 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'
/// position = byteArrayStream.getPosition(); // position is 7
/// remaining = byteArrayStream.getRemaining(); // remaining is 0

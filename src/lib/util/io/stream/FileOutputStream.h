/// The file is specified by its path, or a `File` instance.
/// The stream maintains a current position within the file, which is advanced as data is written.

/// ## Example
/// ```c++
/// const auto file = Util::File("/path/to/file.txt");
/// if (!file.exists()) {
///     file.create();
/// }
///
/// FileOutputStream fileStream(file);
///
/// // Write data to the file one byte at a time
/// fileStream.write('H');
/// fileStream.write('e');
/// fileStream.write('l');
/// fileStream.write('l');
/// fileStream.write('o');
/// fileStream.write(',');
/// fileStream.write(' ');
///
/// // Write a byte array to the file in one operation
/// const char *world = "World!";
/// fileStream.write(reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(world), 0, 6);

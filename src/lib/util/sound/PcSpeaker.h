/// This class provides a user space interface to the PC speaker, allowing it to play sounds at various frequencies.
/// The kernel driver for the PC speaker exposes a file interface, which sets the frequency when written to.
/// This class wraps that file interface and exposes a more convenient API for playing sounds.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```c++
/// auto speaker = Util::Sound::PcSpeaker(Util::Io::File("/device/speaker")); // Create a new PcSpeaker instance
/// bool endOfFile = false; // Indicates whether the input stream has reached EOF
///
/// // Read frequencies from the input stream and play them using the speaker.
/// while (!endOfFile) {
///     // Read a line from the input stream; endOfFile will be set to true if EOF is reached
///     const auto line = Util::System::in.readLine(endOfFile);
///
///     // Parse the frequency from the line and play it
///     // (This example does not handle errors, so it assumes the line is always a valid number)
///     const auto frequency = Util::String::parseNumber<uint16_t>(line);
///     speaker.play(frequency);
/// }
/// ```

/// Creates and manages an audio channel for playback of audio data.
/// Audio samples can be written to the channel, which will then be played back through the audio mixer.
/// Currently, only 8-bit mono PCM audio samples at a sample rate of 22050 Hz are supported.
///
/// On instantiation, a new audio channel is created in the audio mixer.
/// Each channel has a unique ID and is can be accessed through a file in the `/device` directory.
/// This class handles the creation and deletion of audio channels, as well as playback control,
/// abstracting the underlying I/O operations and providing a simple interface for audio playback.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```c++
/// // Create a new audio channel (The constructor automatically requests a new audio channel from the audio mixer)
/// auto audioChannel = Util::Sound::AudioChannel();
///
/// // Open a wave file to play
/// auto waveFile = Util::Sound::WaveFile(Util::Io::File("audio.wav"));
///
/// // Create a buffer to hold the current chunk of audio data.
/// auto *buffer = new uint8_t[8192];
/// auto remaining = waveFile.getDataSize();
///
/// // Start playback of the audio channel (otherwise the mixer will ignore this channel)
/// audioChannel.play();
///
/// // Read the wave in small chunks and write them to the audio channel
/// while (remaining > 0) {
///     // Read a chunk of data from the wave file
///     const auto toRead = remaining >= 8192 ? 8192 : remaining;
///     waveFile.read(buffer, 0, toRead);
///
///     // Write the chunk to the audio channel for playback
///     audioChannel.write(buffer, 0, toRead);
///     remaining -= toRead;
/// }
///
/// // Stop playback of the audio channel (the channel is still valid, but the mixer will not play it for now)
/// audioChannel.stop();
/// ```

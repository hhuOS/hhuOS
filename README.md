## Introduction

Welcome to hhuOS, a **small operating system** written in C++ and Assembler for the x86-architecture. The main purpose of this project is to show how different aspects of operating systems theory can be implemented and linked together. The system is *not* aimed to be a full-featured operating system for daily use.

This is a project by the [Operating Systems group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/operating-systems.html) at the *Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf*.

## Run without building

We provide nightly builds of our `master` and `development` branches via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/releases). Execute the following commands to download and run the latest `master` build in QEMU (on Ubuntu 24.04):

```shell
sudo apt install wget qemu-system-x86
mkdir -p hhuOS
cd hhuOS
wget https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/releases/download/nightly-master/hhuOS-master.tar.gz
tar -xzf hhuOS-master.tar.gz
./run.sh
```

The OS will boot into a shell with some UNIX-like commands. Run `ls /bin` to see all available applications. Try out `bug` and `dino` for some old-fashioned games!

</p>

If QEMU hangs on a black screen, try executing `./run.sh --bios true --file hhuOS-limine.iso`. There seems to be a problem with older QEMU versions and new OVMF images.

## Build from source

GCC (compatible with C++20), CMake (>=3.13) and some other dependencies are required to compile hhuOS. To install them, you can run the following command (on Ubuntu 24.04):

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential nasm gcc-multilib g++-multilib cmake libgl-dev python3 python3-setuptools xorriso dosfstools mtools unzip wget ffmpeg git recode
```

Afterward, clone this repository and execute the included build-script:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS.git
cd hhuOS
git submodule update --init --recursive
./build.sh
```

To test hhuOS in QEMU, simply execute the included run-script:

```shell
./run.sh
```

If QEMU hangs on a black screen, try building an image with [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) bootloader and then running QEMU with a classic BIOS:
```
./build.sh --target limine
./run.sh --bios true --file hhuOS-limine.iso
```
There seems to be a problem with older QEMU versions and new OVMF images.

## What next?

Congratulations! If you have made it this far, you have successfully compiled and run hhuOS! If you have not done so yet, you should definitely try out the included games `bug`, `battlespace`, `dino` and `rogue3d`, as well as the `demo` command, to see the capabilities of our user space game engine. There is also some ported software available for hhuOS (Scroll down for an exhaustive list).

When you are done tinkering with the OS, why not try to build your own application for hhuOS? Our [wiki](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/wiki/) provides tutorials on how to set up a development environment and get started with app development for hhuOS.

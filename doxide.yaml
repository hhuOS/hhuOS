  Welcome to hhuOS, a small operating system written in C++ and Assembler for the x86-architecture.
  The main purpose of this project is to show how different aspects of operating systems theory can be implemented and linked together.
  The system is not aimed to be a full-featured operating system for daily use.
  This is a project by the [Operating Systems group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/operating-systems.html) at the Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf.
